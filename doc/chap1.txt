  [33X[0;0YGAP  Quickcheck  uses  random arguments to test functions. This means that a
  bug  that may come up with a particular combination of arguments may be lost
  and  untraceable.  To  prevent  this, the package caches the seeds of failed
  tests.  When  a  function  is tested, the testing engine looks for the cache
  file.  If  it  is  present  in  the  directory,  and has seeds saved for the
  function being tested, it will use the cached seed in order to replicate the
  failed  test.  Once a seed is no longer producing failed test, it is removed
  from cache.[133X
